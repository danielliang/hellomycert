Hello My Cert
-------------

Just some scripts that use 'openssl' to request/sign certificates
with fewer options and more suitable configuration.

When to use?
------------

* Just need a certificate which will be signed by a CA or is self-signed.

* Sign/revoke certificates as a CA administrator.

Requirements
------------

* openssl

* The scripts, "req.cnf", "ca.cnf.template" should be in the same directory,
  and scripts should be run in the directory.

Just need a certificate
-----------------------

Only use 'req.sh'.
What it does is:
1. To generate a private key first or use an exist key.
2. Then to generate a cetificate request or a self-signed certificate,
   depending on the options.

Example:

* Generate a server ceriticate request:
    $ ./req.sh -server

* Generate a self-signed CA ceriticate (used for a Root CA):
    $ ./req.sh -ca -selfsign

Running 'req.sh' without arguments will show its all options.

As a CA administrator
---------------------

Must use 'ca-initdir' first to create an initial database
in a directory which all related files exclude the scripts should be in,
for signing/revoking certificates.

Example:

* Create a initial database in /tmp/myca: 
    $ ./ca-initdir.sh /tmp/myca

  and then the structure of /tmp/myca looks like:

    /tmp/myca
    |-- ca.cnf
    |-- crlnumber
    |-- index.txt
    |-- newcerts/
    |-- private/
    `-- serial

  Then copy the CA's key and certificate to
  /tmp/myca/private/ca.key and /tmp/myca/ca.crt
  (or other paths matching the "private_key" and "certificate" fileds
  in /tmp/myca/ca.cnf if /tmp/myca/ca.cnf is customized) for
  other scripts to work with them.

* Use the CA in /tmp/myca to sign a server certificate request:
    $ ./ca-signcert.sh /tmp/myca ~/alice.csr -server

  The new certificate will be in /tmp/myca/newcerts/ if /tmp/myca/ca.cnf keeps default.

* Use the CA in /tmp/myca to sign a CA certificate request and certify it for 10 years:
    $ ./ca-signcert.sh /tmp/myca ~/subca.csr -ca 3650

* Revoke a certificate signed by the CA in /tmp/myca:
    $ ./ca-revoke.sh /tmp/myca /etc/ssl/certs/old.crt

* Generate a CRL based on information in /tmp/myca/index.txt
    $ ./ca-gencrl.sh /tmp/myca

Running them without arguments will show their all options.
